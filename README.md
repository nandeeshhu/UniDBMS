### **I. INTRODUCTION**

In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, data management within institutions has emerged as a critical area requiring innovative solutions. This report explores the development and implementation of the University Database Management System (UniDBMS), which focuses on creating a robust database management system (DBMS) to streamline and secure data handling in educational institutions.

Historically, educational institutions have struggled to manage vast amounts of data, from student records and faculty details to course curricula and administrative information. The decentralized and fragmented systems often used led to inefficiencies, data redundancy, and security issues. UniDBMS addresses these challenges by centralizing data management, improving data integrity, security, and accessibility.

This report outlines the design and implementation of UniDBMS, focusing on the system’s architecture, key functionalities, and the role of DBMS in modernizing data management practices in educational institutions.
